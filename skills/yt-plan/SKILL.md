  Plan a week or a month of YouTube uploads - what to post, when, and in
  what order, sized to the creator's actual capacity. Use for "plan my
  week", "content calendar", "what should I post", "I have no idea what to
  make next".

# yt-plan

A plan that does not fit the week is a list of regrets. Ask two questions before writing anything:
**how many hours do you actually have**, and **what is already half-made**.

## Before you write

1. Read `.claude/youtube/voice.md` in the current project if it exists. Each channel lives in its
   own project folder with its own profile, so never read or write `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md`.
   That is the user's voice profile: how they talk on camera, the words they never use, who they
   are talking to, what they will not claim. If it does not exist, or is still the blank
   template, run `/yt-voice`: it builds the file from the user's own videos or, for a channel with
   none yet, from a recorded voice test. Read `.claude/youtube/style.md` too if it exists - the
   format, cadence and packaging rules for this channel. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The shape of a week

- **One anchor.** The video the week is for. It gets the most time and it goes out on the day the
  channel's own analytics say is best - ask for that, do not assume Tuesday.
- **One cheap one.** Built from something that exists: a clip, a reaction, a follow-up to the
  comment that got the most replies last week.
- **Shorts from the anchor.** Three, cut from the long video, not written separately. `/yt-shorts`
  finds them.

Three uploads on a seven-day week, not seven. A plan that posts daily is not a plan anyone
recognises, and the empty days are what make the filled ones survive a bad week.

## What to hand back

A table: day, format, working title, the one sentence it promises, and what already exists for it.
Then the honest line at the bottom - how many hours this costs, and what to drop first if the week
goes wrong.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
